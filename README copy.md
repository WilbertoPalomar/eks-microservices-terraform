## Architecture

![alt Bookstore Architecture](Bookstore-EKS-Arch.jpg)

## Steps to run locally without build
1. Create 4 DynamoDb tables into your AWS Cloud (development-inventory, development-resources, development-renting, development-clients)  by reffering tf_modules/dynamodb folder.
2. Run Docker compose file named `docker-compose-image.yaml` using command 
```
docker compose -f .\docker-compose-image.yaml up

```
3. Open the URL on `http://localhost:80`

## Steps to run locally with build
1. Create 4 DynamoDb tables into your AWS Cloud (development-inventory, development-resources, development-renting, development-clients)  by reffering tf_modules/dynamodb folder.
2. Run Docker compose file named `docker-compose.yaml` using command. It will take some time to build and start the containers.
```
docker compose up

```
3. Open the URL `http://localhost:80`

## Steps to Deploy into AWS Cloud using Helm.
1. AWS CLI setup with Admin Role.
2. Generate Code Commit Authentication from IAM.
3. Update Hosted zone in file `infrastructure\eks\terraform\terraform.tfvars` and Run `bookstore_create_infra.sh` to create infrastructure.
4. Update below files and run `bookstore_setup_k8s.sh`
- Update Cluster Name `--cluster-name` in  `infrastructure\k8s-tooling\alb-controller\alb-ingress-controller.yaml` file.
- Update Role ARN `roleARN` in `infrastructure\k8s-tooling\app-mesh\appmesh-sa\values.yaml` of Service Account for App Mesh. IAM Role ending with `sa-app-mesh-role`
5. Build Resource API and update `resource-api\infra\helm\values.development.yaml` file with Repo , Tag and Service Account Role ending with `development-sa-resource-api-role`
```
cd resource-api
docker build -t <Docker HUb Account>/bookstoreapp_resource-api .
docker push <Docker HUb Account>/bookstoreapp_resource-api
```
6. Run Resource API
```
./create.sh development
```
7. Build Inventory API and update `inventory-api\infra\helm\values.development.yaml` file with Repo , Tag and Service Account Role ending with `development-sa-inventory-api-role`
```
cd inventory-api
docker build -t <Docker HUb Account>/bookstoreapp_inventory-api .
docker push <Docker HUb Account>/bookstoreapp_inventory-api
```
8. Run Inventory API
```
./create.sh development
```
9. Build Clients API and update `clients-api\infra\helm\values.development.yaml` file with Repo , Tag and Service Account Role ending with `development-sa-clients-api-role`
```
cd clients-api
docker build -t <Docker HUb Account>/bookstoreapp_clients-api .
docker push <Docker HUb Account>/bookstoreapp_clients-api
```
10. Run Clients API
```
./create.sh development
```
11. Build Renting API and update `renting-api\infra\helm\values.development.yaml` file with Repo , Tag and Service Account Role ending with `development-sa-renting-api-role`
```
cd renting-api
docker build -t <Docker HUb Account>/bookstoreapp_renting-api .
docker push <Docker HUb Account>/bookstoreapp_renting-api
```
12. Run Renting API
```
./create.sh development
```
13. Build Front End and update `front-end\infra\helm\values.development.yaml` file with Repo , Tag and Service Account Role ending with `development-sa-renting-api-role` and Hosted Zone.
```
cd front-end
docker build -t <Docker HUb Account>/bookstoreapp_front-end .
docker push <Docker HUb Account>/bookstoreapp_front-end
```
14. Run Front End
```
./create.sh development
```
15. Go to infrastructure/k8s-tooling/central-ingress and update your own HOSTED ZONE and run
```
./create.sh development
```
16. Verify the Application using the URL.  https://dev.bookstore.`UR-HOSTED-ZONE`
17. Deploy production using below scripts.
```
cd resource-api
./create.sh prod
cd inventory-api
./create.sh prod
cd clients-api
./create.sh prod
cd renting-api
./create.sh prod
cd front-end
./create.sh prod
infrastructure/k8s-tooling/central-ingress
./create.sh prod
```
16. Verify the Application using the URL.  https://bookstore.`UR-HOSTED-ZONE`

## Steps to Deploy into AWS Cloud using CI/CD Pipeline
1. AWS CLI setup with Admin Role.
2. Generate Code Commit Authentication from IAM.
3. Update Hosted zone in file `infrastructure\eks\terraform\terraform.tfvars` and Run `bookstore_create_infra.sh` to create infrastructure.
4. Add RBAC for Code Build Jobs using below commands.
```
A. kubectl get -n kube-system configmap/aws-auth -o yaml
//Copy output and create YAML file and update it with each build job role.
- rolearn: <ROLE ARN>
      username: build-<APP NAME>
      groups:
      - system:masters
B. kubectl apply -f .\auth-config.yaml
```
5. Run cicd script to push codes into Code Commit.
```
./bookstore_cicd.sh 

```
6. Once deployment is complete in AWS CodePipeline for Dev stage. Go to infrastructure/k8s-tooling/central-ingress and update your own HOSTED ZONE and run
```
./create.sh development
```
7. Verify the Application using the URL.  https://dev.bookstore.`UR-HOSTED-ZONE`
8. Go to each Pipeline and confirm to deploy the application into production environment.
9. Once deployment is complete in AWS CodePipeline for Prod Stage. Go to infrastructure/k8s-tooling/central-ingress and update your own HOSTED ZONE and run
```
./create.sh prod
```
#### Access production application via https://bookstore.`YOUR-HOSTED-ZONE`

**Note**- if Code Build is failing with error `toomanyrequests: You have reached your pull rate limit.`. You can run the job again after 5 min wait.

## Clean Up step.
1. Delete namespaces. Go to `infrastructure\k8s-tooling\namespaces`
```
 kubectl delete -f development.yaml
 kubectl delete -f prod.yaml
 kubectl delete -f appmesh-system.yaml
```
2. Remove K8S. 
```
kubectl delete -f infrastructure\k8s-tooling\alb-controller\alb-ingress-controller.yaml
kubectl delete -f infrastructure\k8s-tooling\external-dns\external-dns.yaml
```
3. Delete AwS resource from Terraform.
- Go to each API Folder/infra/terraform and run `terraform destroy`
- Go to  infrastructure\cicd\terraform and run `terraform destroy`
- Go to infrastructure\eks\terraform and run `terraform destroy`
